This is the repo that contains the code that runs my [about me](http://about.tommyparnell.com) page. Originally I was going to have some backend things, hence the use of some c#, but in the future I may just make this HTML, and publish via github pages.

## Hosting

This is currently hosted on Azure. Azure will auto deploy on master branch commits
